# ðŸ“œ pages

`pages` provides web application / static site hosting with built-in support for simple analytics via [Prometheus][] and
[Grafana][].

[Prometheus]: https://prometheus.io
[Grafana]: https://grafana.com

**Motivation**

As I work to reduce the number of Google services from my life, I found myself wanting a simpler alternative to my 
current hosting solution. Right now, my hosting is provided by GitHub pages and my analytics is provided by Google (as 
one did in th 2010s). But as we start to enforce more privacy rights through systems like GDPR, I find myself wanting a
simpler solution that doesn't require cookie disclosures.
